During checkout, always ask the customer for a shipping address. Useful if you have virtual products that still need a shipping address.

== Description ==

In WooCommerce, if a customer orders only virtual products from your store, they aren't asked for a shipping address during checkout.

This plugin ensures that the customer must enter a shipping address.

Useful if you have virtual products that still need a shipping address.

Also useful if you have products where their shipping cost is included in their price. For these products, set them as virtual products, and activate this plugin.

If the customer buys only virtual products, they will be able to check out without selecting a shipping method.
If the customer buys a combination of virtual and physical products, their shipping costs will only include the physical products (ie. the virtual products are excluded from the shipping cost calculations).
